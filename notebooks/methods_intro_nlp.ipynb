    "## Collocations\n",
    "\n",
    "Collocations are a set of words that occur together more often than chance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Linguistics may focus more on discovering these,\n",
    "while e.g. language learning uses the results to highlight and teach grammatical idiosyncracies, \n",
    "e.g. that we have a _bright_ idea (rather than), may prefer _strong_ tea (rather than powerful),\n",
    "_make_ a bed (and that that means we tidy rather than construct it),\n",
    "ships have a maiden voyage (historical use, okay?).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you see collocations mentioned as an analytical method, it is statistics applied to find such terms. \n",
    "Often relatively basic statistics, and a fundemantally comparative thing - 'more than chance' is based on\n",
    "using some text for reference of how common things are.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be a general corpus of text, but could also be the dataset itself,\n",
    "which gives different results, akin to asking a layperson or legal analist what text jumps out at them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Collocation tends to give messy output, for a number of relatively basic reasons,\n",
    "such as that it is naive of the edges of phrases, so outputs a lot of things involving only part of a phrase, e.g. \n",
    "you'll get '634 bedoelde minimum' instead of 'het in artikel 634 bedoelde minimum', \n",
    "and NLP can help with this in concept - yet but that specific example isn't the easiest case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sure it'll pick up interesting things like 'inkomen naar arbeidsvermogen' and 'schuldsaneringsregeling natuurlijke personen'.\n",
    "\n",
    "...but there's lots more things that just happen to be regular constructions, like 'Hetzelfde geldt', 'door verloop',\n",
    "'indien zij', 'heeft ingestemd', 'mede gelet', 'tijdstip waarop', 'als bedoeld', 'ter zake', 'ten nadele'. \n",
    "Are those worth noting at all? Sure.  Are they very meaningful? Not so much.\n",
    "\n",
    "More importantly, can you tell them apart? Again, not easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Collocation analysis is a relatively blunt instrument,\n",
    "useful to picking up names of people, names of things (which may include interesting topics), jargon, and such, but not much more."
