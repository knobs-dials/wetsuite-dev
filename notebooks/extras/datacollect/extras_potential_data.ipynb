    "but in a lot of places you will just see the identifier (like 32016R0679) \n",
    "and you will need to assume from context that this is _probably_ a CELEX identifier.\n",

    "Luckily, the document type being a letter in the middle is good indication.\n",

    "* 7 are national transposition measures\n",
    "  - member states can choose the form for transposing EU directives into national law, who then notify the EU, and EUR-Lex publishes metadata (title, date of publication, transposed directive/s, etc.) and ''optionally'' the text   (see also [National transposition](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/collection/n-law/mne.html)) \n",
