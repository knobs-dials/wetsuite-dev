    "### Basic motivation of tf-idf\n",
    "\n",
    "tf-idf was introduced in the 1970s as a heuristic of 'term specificity', \n",
    "based on two rough intuitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "A term more common in a document is probably important to that document\n",
    "but _at the same time_, a term common to all documents is probably less important in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "- term frequency (tf) is often calculated as `(count of term within document / total terms in document)` - so counts expressed as a ratio.\n",
    "- document frequency (df) is often calculated as `log( count of documents / count of documents that contain the term )`. \n",
    "- The word 'inverse' just indicates that we *divide* by this. IDF is just 1 / DF\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Those ways of calculating are the basics.\n",
    "Specific applications may have variant calculations they still call tf-idf (we mention this because if you use someone else's code, it may well use such an alternative, and not show the same values as a basic tutorial would)."

    "## What does it give you, and what can you do with it?\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF isn't a method or goal, it's a tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, by itself it's barely a tool, in that the table/matrix itself is,\n",
    "for each term, just *data* - a weight for each document a term is in.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of that data lies in the application,\n",
    "and different things may use that data very differently. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Say, if you're doing scores, you probably want some logs in there.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are inspecting a collection of documents for what might be more unique and topical terms, \n",
    "you might wish to exclude terms appearing in most documents, just to ignore a lot of muck.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're creating a field-specific stopword list, or perhaps estimate how _not_ to the point a document is,\n",
    "the muck is exactly what you are interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What could you do?\n",
    "\n",
    "* score results in a search system - idf means putting little weight in things not interested in the document set, tf means focusing more on specifics\n",
    "\n",
    "* make stopword lists / automatically downweigh repetitive words\n",
    "  things you would consider stopwords will automatically grow the highest IDF\n",
    "  and it's a gliding scale with other words that happen to be common\n",
    "\n",
    "* try to score a document for how repetitive or overcomplete something is\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the larger and more heterogenous the document set, the more diluted some effects are,\n",
    "and some uses stand and fall with a little control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you're comparing all possible media products, then terms like 'film', 'book', 'album' are very distinguishing,\n",
    "and you may want those to be reported so you can partition them later.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're looking at all your products this will be stronger.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're looking just within movie reviews, or just within all book reviews, or just album reviews, \n",
    "then these are the terms you want to fall away.\n",
    "\n",
    "IDF, when calculated for such a specific collection, will basically do that for you,\n",
    "but when you want to do things based on the result, you should be aware of this context sensitivity,\n",
    "and you may want to do a little more curation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- -->\n",
    "\n",
    "You should not assume its output is linear or usable as probabilities - it's ordinal, but distribution is skewed,\n",
    "so this isn't even very good input to a lot of methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's better than nothing, and e.g. in result scoring the values themselves don't have to make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying log will help, but not \n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- -->\n",
    "\n",
    "You should not assume the output lets you do direct comparisons anyway -- \n",
    "the numbers you end up with in the table is based on ratios within the document,\n",
    "which means that longer document have lower values on each term by definition,\n",
    "which may not match your intuition of how much about certain terms it is.\n",

    "### Other notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you see the results of TF-IDF calculation as document-by-term matrix that happens to be sparsely filled, or another way,\n",
    "depends a little on implementation and intent.\n",
