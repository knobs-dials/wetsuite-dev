    "(and sometimes to and to regulations).\n",
    "\n",
    "The application to laws will be within [[BWB|basis wetten bestand]],\n",

    "and e.g. adds the ability to refer to specific parts.\n",
    "\n",

    "  - little to no structural changes between versions. Most difference relates to the meaning of fields like date.\n",

    "- so only with these dates can it be a identifier referring to to a specific version, and unambiguously to actual text.\n",

    "- Where are **locatie string** is mentioned, it refers to the part of the key-value fragment\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "However, it is possible that the text says it will apply retroactivity, \n",
    ": in which case the legal test applies _before_ its inwerktredingsdatum,\n",
    ": and the geldigheidsperiode will overlap with another\n",
    "\n",
    "And note that since we are referring to **consolidations**, instructions to modify a law can be seen as \"create a new consolidation, with the exact same geldigheidsperiode\".\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- -->\n",
    "\n",
    "This means 1.2's references with just geldigheidsdatum would not be unambiguous for these cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Juriconnect 1.3 resolves these, via the concepts of zichtdatum and zichtbaarheidsperiode\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the documentation's example, consider\n",
    "- consolidation X1 with a geldigheidsperiode of 1/1/2010 through 31/12/2010\n",
    "- wijzigingsinstructie Z (in 2011) implicitly creates consolidation X2 - also with geldigheidsperiode 1/1/2010 through 31/12/2010\n",
    "\n",
    "A zichtdatum of 1/7/2010 would amount to \"as best we knew at that time\", i.e. X1.\n",
