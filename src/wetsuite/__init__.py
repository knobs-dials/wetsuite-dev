' wetsuite is a set of tools that helps researchers and others deal with legal and other government documents  '

# these are packages for organisation, but it may be nice if they get loaded if you 'import wetsuite' so you don't have to importy each separately
#import wetsuite.datacollect as datacollect
#import wetsuite.datasets as datasets
#import wetsuite.helpers as helpers
# TODO: think about edge cases, I remember this being more finicky than it pretends to be
# TODO: think about how far to go, and about consistency. It would be weird if only some of the modules are loaded
