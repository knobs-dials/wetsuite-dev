              - if you just want it to do things until it's done, you can do `list( fetcher.work() )`

            Will only go deeper from the starting page you give it.

            Note that there actually is no real distinction between what this class calls folders and pages,
            but the way the repositories are structured, pretending this is true helps us go into what we added
            as folders before what we added as pages, do that we act depth-first-like.
            (and will e.g. start fetching documents before we've gone through all pages,
            which seems like a good idea when some things have 100K pages, and there are reasons 
            our fetching gets interrupted)

            On a similar note, we cache things we consider folders, not things we consider pages 
            (because we assume many things at a level means it's the level (or at least a level)
            at which things get added over time. As such, you can make the folder store persistent
            and it saves _some_ time updating a local copy.
