## Examples

Some python notebooks that demonstrate how to get started with specific wetsuite functionality and/or datasets.

These notebooks have an "Open in colab" link, which gives you your own copy running in a temporary google colab instance, that you can experiment with at will.
This is meant as a low-threshold start, and demonstration of feature.
For serious use you will probably prefer your own infrastructure.
