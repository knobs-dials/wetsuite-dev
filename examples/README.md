## Examples

Some demonstations of how to get started with specific wetsuite functionality and/or datasets.


These are python notebooks, which can be copied into a relatively visual environment,
and that copy can be edited, which lets you experiment more easily, and lets us demonstrate code, with annotation.

While you can load them into your local python environment, these notebooks include links to quickly load these into [google colab](), a (temporary) sandbox in which you can freely play without installation, so is useful for annotated demonstrations without requiring any setup in your own infrastructure. ...something you probably _do_ want to do once you care to use this as a library in more serious projects.
