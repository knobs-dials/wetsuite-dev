## Examples

These are python notebooks, which are a relatively visual environment, and you can work on a copy of a notebook to ease some interactive experimentation. 
It also lets us demonstrate code, with annotation.  

Currently these notebooks focus on some specific wetsuite functionality, datasets, and/or explaining some backing techniques.


When you view the notebooks (e.g. here on github) and click the "Open in Colab" link, you will get a copy running in [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), which gives you a very temporary sandbox in which you can freely play, useful for experimentation and demonstrations without requiring any setup in your own infrastructure. 

Once you care to use this as a library in more serious projects, you probably want to install onto your own infrastructure.
