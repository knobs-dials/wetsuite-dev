## Examples

Some demonstations of how to get started with specific wetsuite functionality and/or datasets.


These are python notebooks (Each cell is a fragment of code, executed one at a time, often in sequence),
which let you experiment with code with less back-and-forth between editor and running a script, 
and lets us demonstrate code with easier annotation.


These notebooks include links to load these in google colab, an online platform that can run these without installation (in a temporary instance),
so that you can do some initial experiments without the bother of setting up on your own infrastructure. 
Which you probably _do_ want to do when using this library in more serious projects.
