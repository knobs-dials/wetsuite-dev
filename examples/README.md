## Examples

These are some python notebooks that demonstrate how to get started with specific wetsuite functionality or datasets.

If you click the "Open in colab", you will get your own copy of these notebooks running in google colab, that you can experiment with at will.
This is meant as a low-threshold start, though for serious use you might prefer your own infrastructure.
