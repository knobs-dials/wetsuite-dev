## Examples

These are python notebooks, which are a relatively visual environment,
and you can work on a copy of a notebook to ease some interactive experimentation. 

It also lets us demonstrate code, with annotation.  Currently it focuses on some specific wetsuite functionality, datasets, and/or explaining some backing techniques.

While you can load them into your local python environment, these notebooks include links to quickly load these into [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), which gives you a very temporary sandbox in which you can freely play, which makes it useful for demonstrations without requiring any setup in your own infrastructure. ...something you probably _do_ want to do once you care to use this as a library in more serious projects.
