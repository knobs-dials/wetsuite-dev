version to test installs from github



This repository is split into:
- [src](src/wetsuite/) - the part of this project that you would install - eventually via pypi (TODO) - which also has a more detailed README
- [examples](examples/) - python notebooks that demonstrate the use of varied package tools,  datasets,  and related things
