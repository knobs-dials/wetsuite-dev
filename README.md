version to test installs from github


This repository is split into:
- [src](src/wetsuite/) - the part of this project that you would install and use
- `notebooks` groups
  - [examples](notebooks/examples/) - python notebooks that demonstrate the use of varied package tools,  datasets,  and related things
  - [miscellany](notebooks/miscellany/) - things that are not core wetsuite functionality, but may be useful to people anyway, including examples of code in [src/extras/](src/extras/)
